# CodeGenerator

The `CodeGenerator` essentially generates corresponding source code based on the SDK's project files. For example, it can use an STM32CubeMX IOC file to generate the relevant C++ peripheral initialization code. This chapter mainly discusses the usage of code generation and configuration, and does not include the usage of specific APIs.
