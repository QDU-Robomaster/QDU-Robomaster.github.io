# About This Project

XRobot originated from [qdu-rm-mcu](https://gitee.com/qsheeeeen/qdu-rm-mcu.git), created by [@qsheeeeen](https://gitee.com/qsheeeeen) on January 19, 2019. Since then, it has served as the electrical control framework for the Robomaster Future Team at Qingdao University and has also been adopted by various universities and companies.

Over the years, XRobot has evolved from a simple Keil MDK-based MCU codebase for a combat vehicle into a cross-platform embedded software frameworkâ€”and now, into a powerful toolchain covering the full embedded development lifecycle. After weathering many challenges, XRobot 2.0 is officially released, and we look forward to progressing together with you.
