# RBTree (Red-Black Tree)

`LibXR::RBTree<Key>` is a generic, thread-safe red-black tree implementation that supports insertion, deletion, lookup, and traversal. It is ideal for embedded data structure scenarios involving key-value indexing, automatic sorting, and memory resource mapping.

## Key Features

- Self-balancing binary search tree with O(log n) insertion/deletion complexity
- Supports generic Key and Value types
- Provides templated node class `Node<T>` and abstract base `BaseNode`
- All operations are thread-safe via `Mutex` protection
- Supports traversal and in-order iteration
- Internally uses classic red-black tree rotations and color fix-up mechanisms

## Class Structure

- `BaseNode`: Abstract node type, includes key, color, parent/child pointers, and size info
- `Node<Data>`: Templated node type encapsulating user data
- `RBTree<Key>`: Red-black tree container supporting generic key comparison

## Interface Overview

### Constructor and Initialization

```cpp
RBTree<Key> tree(compare_fun);
```

- `compare_fun` is a user-defined comparison function: `int(const Key&, const Key&)`

### Insertion and Deletion

```cpp
void Insert(BaseNode& node, Key&& key);
void Delete(BaseNode& node);
```

- When inserting, assign a key and the tree will automatically balance itself
- Deletion works on any node and also rebalances the tree structure

### Search

```cpp
template <typename Data>
Node<Data>* Search(const Key& key);
```

- Returns the pointer to the node with the given key, or `nullptr` if not found

### Traversal

```cpp
template <typename Data, typename Func>
ErrorCode Foreach(Func func);
```

- In-order traversal that invokes `func` on each `Node<Data>`

### Iteration Interface

```cpp
Node<Data>* ForeachDisc(Node<Data>* node);
```

- Returns the next node in in-order sequence; pass `nullptr` to start

### Node Usage Example

```cpp
RBTree<int> tree(cmp);
RBTree<int>::Node<std::string> n1("hello");
tree.Insert(n1, 42);
```

## Notes

- All operations are thread-safe, but node lifetime is user-managed
- Node type must be known and fixed before usage
- Node size is validated at runtime to prevent type mismatches

## Application Scenarios

- Ordered object storage and retrieval
- Configuration item lookup (e.g., string-to-value maps)
- Mapping structures (e.g., resource ID to object mapping)
